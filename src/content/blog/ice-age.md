Back in the **Ice Age**, the world was just **5°C colder** than it was in 1990.  

When I first heard that, I was **floored**.  
In Europe, the average global temperature was only 5°C lower than in 1990… yet there were *kilometres of ice*  across the continent (up to <a href="https://icemap.no/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,000 meters</a>]!!) .  
A massive ice sheet stretching from **Ireland all the way to eastern Russia** (6,600,000 km²~).

We often hear

> “A 2.5°C rise could be dramatic.”

I’d heard it too. But I never really fully grasped what that meant.  

In my head, +2.5°C just meant **warmer summers**: 28–30°C instead of 26–28°C.  
Not so bad, right?  

But the reality is nothing like that.  

If –5°C was enough to plunge us into an **Ice Age**, imagine what **+2.5°C** could do to the world we live in now. 


P.S. Today’s headlines might already give you an hint: record temperatures, raging wildfires, floods and melting glaciers destryoing villages.

P.P.S. According to the World Meteorological Organization <a href="https://wmo.int/media/news/global-climate-predictions-show-temperatures-expected-remain-or-near-record-levels-coming-5-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WMO</a> , global average temperatures are expected to remain near record-high levels for the next five years (2025-2029), with an 86% chance of at least one year exceeding the 1.5°C pre-industrial warming threshold.
