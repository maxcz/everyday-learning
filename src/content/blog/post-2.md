Back in the **Ice Age**, the world was just **5°C colder** than it was in 1990.  

When I first heard that, I was **floored**.  
In Europe, the average global temperature was only 5°C lower than in 1990… yet there were *kilometres of ice*  across the continent (up to **3,000 meters**!!) .  
A massive ice sheet stretching from **Ireland** all the way to **eastern Russia** (6,600,000 km²~).  

We often hear

> “A 2.5°C rise could be dramatic.”

I’d heard it too, but I never really grasped what that meant.  

In my head, +2.5°C just meant **warmer summers**: 28–30°C instead of 24–25°C.  
Not so bad, right?  

But the reality is nothing like that.  
If –5°C was enough to plunge us into an **Ice Age**, just imagine what **+2.5°C** could do to the world we live in now. 

P.S. Today’s headlines might already give you an hint: record temperatures, raging megafires, melting glaciers destryoing villages.
