*Inspiration/Source: Book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48528524-awareness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awareness</a> by Anthony De Mello, lived experience* 


**Note:** The thoughts below are my own understanding after listening to *Awareness* by Anthony de Mello. They are not “the truth” or a prescription; simply what clicked for me and what I use in my everyday life.

When you’re not aware of your emotions, you’re not in control.  
Your emotions tend to run the show.

When you do reach a state of awareness, you can contemplate your emotions.  
You can see them for what they are.  
You notice and observe them without letting them take hold of you.

The more you personalise “being anxious,” the more anxious you become.  
Emotions are like clouds: they come and go.  
What helps me most: notice them, acknowledge their presence, and let them pass.  
When I add stories or judgments, they seem to stay longer and grow larger.

Being self-aware does not mean you will be emotionless. You will continue to feel emotions; for example, sadness or heaviness.  
The difference is that, when you’re self-aware, you can take a step back. You see the emotion for what it is; you acknowledge its presence and let it pass, just as the sky allows clouds to move on.
