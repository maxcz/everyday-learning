Am I the person I want my child to grow up to be?

It’s a disarming question, and a useful compass.

**Children read us before they hear us.**  

Your face is what your kid remembers when they see you the first time you walk in the room.  

Do you light up? Are you tense?

That look teaches them what to expect from the world.

As Toni Morrison puts it:
> “let your face show what’s in your heart.”

If the first words every morning are “Comb your hair” or “Brush your teeth,” the message (even if unintended) can sound like “You’re not quite right yet.”  

If they regularly see anger or harshness, they’ll learn to brace.  

The same is true in the other direction: steady love and small acts of kindness teach safety, worth, and curiosity.

This isn’t about perfect parenting, it’s about **repeated signals**.

Done most days, these small signals add up.  

And what we model, over time, shapes how kids see themselves and others.
