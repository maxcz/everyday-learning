                Hey, I'm <strong>Max</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm curious about people & science, and I help companies grow.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I've always been fascinated by how people think, decide, and interact. Human minds are incredibly complex and unique and yet often surprisingly predictable.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Learning is my fuel. Whether it’s through audiobooks and podcasts, around a table with friends and family, or in discussions with colleagues, it’s the lens I use to make sense of the world and keep growing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since 2011, I've been channeling that curiosity into helping companies grow. I've worked with businesses from zero to €100M ARR across ecommerce, SaaS, consumer products, and web3. Whatever the context, I start by understanding people. They're the cornerstone of every buying decision and the heartbeat of every business.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From there, I design systems that make growth sustainable. Sometimes that means building acquisition and retention loops. Sometimes it's defining the right metrics, creating creative campaigns, aligning product and marketing, or applying behavioral science to improve conversion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I most often work at the intersection of product and marketing (aka growth marketing), because I enjoy having a holistic view and impact on the whole journey; not just the top of the funnel.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If there's one thing I've learned, it's this: <strong>tools change fast, but people's underlying drivers don't</strong>. That's why I keep coming back to psychology and basic principles: understand the pain, build trust, tell the right story at the right time, the rest usually follows.
