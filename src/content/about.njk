                Hey, I'm Max.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm curious about people & science, and I do (growth) marketing.

                Learning is my fuel.<br />
                Whether it’s through audiobooks and podcasts, around a table with friends and family, or in discussions with colleagues; it’s the lens I use to make sense of the world and keep growing. <br />
                Happy to share some of these learnings here with you, and hope it sparks something for you too :)

            <p>
                I've always been fascinated by how people think, decide, and interact. Human minds are incredibly complex and unique, and yet often surprisingly predictable.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since 2011, I've been channeling my curiosity into helping companies grow. I've worked with businesses from 0 to €100M ARR across ecommerce, SaaS, consumer products, and web3. <br />
                Whatever the context, I start by understanding people. They're the heartbeat of every business.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From there, I design systems that make growth sustainable. <br />
                Sometimes that means building acquisition and retention loops. <br />
                Sometimes it's defining the right metrics, crafting creative campaigns, aligning product and marketing, or applying behavioral science to improve conversion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I most often work at the intersection of product and marketing (aka growth marketing). I enjoy having a holistic view and impact on the whole journey; not just the top of the funnel.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If there's one thing I've learned, it's this: tools change fast, but people's underlying drivers don't.<br />
                That's why I keep coming back to psychology and basic principles: understand the pain, build trust, tell the right story at the right time, the rest usually follows.
